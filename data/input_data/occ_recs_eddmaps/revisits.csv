The pictured seedlings were marked for control in the spring or early summer.The area with the highest concentration of V. rossicum is approximately the location of the inset rectangle within the larger one, which includes V. rossicum that varies in density.

The extent of the Vincetoxicum rossicum appears to be the same as last year but this will only fully be known during the summer. Most maturing plants, of which there were considerably less than last year, were uprooted. Seedlings, unless beside an uprooted maturing plant, were left. When discovered and at the beginning of last year, more than half of the site was growing almost a monoculture of V. rossicum. This section was covered with a black tarp-like material. Although some holes in it were patched (as before, using blue Tuck tape), since it is planned for the tarp to be removed in mid-June, complete solarization around the holes (where sunlight has entered) will be unlikely. V. rossicum that was growing through the holes was either uprooted (if it could be done without enlarging the holes significantly) or tucked under so that it can be easily seen when the tarp is removed). There are a number of small patches (< 0.25 sq m) of seedlings. These were purposely left last year for controlling this year. And there are of course some with new seedlings that weren't there last year. I scraped away the seedlings in one of these patches a few weeks ago using a garden hand rake with solid tines. There are a few new seedlings in the spot but certainly not as many as there were before raking.",,,,Not Verified,,
